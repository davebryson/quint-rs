//! Random number generator using the squares-rnd algorithm.
//!
//! This is stateful and stable. During a single Quint simulation, this can be
//! called many times. Whenever the same simulation (same Quint modules and
//! parameters) is run again, if the same seed is used, it should yield the same
//! results. It should also be possible to get the seed from intermediate
//! states, as we often run many simulations and then only want to re-run a
//! specific one (one of the samples), so we should be able to get the seed for
//! that one.
